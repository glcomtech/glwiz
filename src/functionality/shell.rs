/// `sudo` privileges. It is part of the "glwiz" project’s post-installation setup to provide
/// an enhanced shell experience. The function logs success or failure and is used for both
/// regular users and the root user.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `name` - The username for which to set Zsh as the default shell (e.g., `"user"`, `"root"`).
///
/// # Returns
/// * `0` - The shell was successfully changed to Zsh.
/// * `1` - An error occurred, such as a failed `chsh` command or invalid username.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns `1` if:
/// - The `chsh` command fails due to permissions, invalid shell path, or non-existent user.
/// - The `sudo` execution encounters an error (e.g., `sudo` not installed).
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use glwiz::functionality::shell::change_def_shell;
/// let result = change_def_shell("user");
/// assert_eq!(result, 0); // Zsh set successfully for user
/// ```
///
/// # See Also
/// - `commands::run_sudo_command`: Used to execute `chsh` with `sudo`.
/// - `configs::user_config_setup`: Configures Zsh settings after shell change.
