/// Retrieves the value of a specified environment variable for system configuration.
///
/// This function fetches the value of an environment variable (e.g., `USER`, `HOME`) and is used
/// in the "gnulinwiz" project to gather user-specific data during post-installation setup. It ensures
/// robust error handling by returning a descriptive error message if the variable is unset or
/// invalid. The function is critical for tasks like configuring user environments and detecting
/// system settings, providing a safe interface to `std::env::var`.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env_var` - The name of the environment variable to retrieve (e.g., `"USER"`, `"HOME"`).
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(String)` - The value of the environment variable as a `String`.
/// * `Err(String)` - An error message if the variable is unset or contains invalid Unicode.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if:
/// - The environment variable is not set.
/// - The variableâ€™s value contains invalid Unicode, preventing conversion to a `String`.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use gnulinwiz::functionality::env::get_env_var;
/// match get_env_var("USER") {
///     Ok(username) => println!("Current user: {}", username),
///     Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # See Also
/// - `user_cfg::UserCfg`: Uses this function to set user-specific configuration data.
/// - `std::env::var`: The underlying Rust function for environment variable access.
