/// Configures ZRAM swap to optimize system memory usage.
///
/// This function sets up ZRAM (compressed RAM-based swap) by copying a predefined configuration
/// file from `../configs/zram-generator.conf` to `/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf`. It is part
/// of the "glwiz" project’s post-installation setup to enhance system performance by providing
/// fast, compressed swap space. The function checks for the source file’s existence and prompts
/// the user to overwrite the destination if it exists, ensuring idempotent operation. It uses
/// `sudo` to write to the system directory, guaranteeing proper permissions.
///
/// # Returns
/// * `0` - The ZRAM configuration was successfully applied or skipped (user chose not to overwrite).
/// * `1` - An error occurred, such as a missing source file or failed copy operation.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns `1` if:
/// - The source file `../configs/zram-generator.conf` does not exist.
/// - The copy operation fails due to permissions or `sudo` issues.
///
/// # Example
/// ```should_panic
/// // Requires ../configs/zram-generator.conf and sudo privileges.
/// // Use integration tests for actual validation.
/// use glwiz::functionality::zram::zram_swap_setup;
/// let result = zram_swap_setup();
/// assert_eq!(result, 0); // Success if config exists and no overwrite
/// ```
/// 
/// # See Also
/// - `commands::run_sudo_command`: Used to copy the configuration file with `sudo`.
/// - `prog_fun::read_input`: Used to prompt for overwrite confirmation.
