/// Executes a system command with `sudo` privileges, requiring elevated permissions.
///
/// This function runs a specified command with `sudo`, passing the provided arguments, and captures
/// its output. It is used in the "glwiz" project for tasks requiring root access, such as copying
/// configuration files to system directories or applying iptables rules. The function ensures robust
/// error handling by reporting command failures with detailed stdout and stderr messages.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `command` - The command to execute (e.g., `"cp"`, `"iptables-restore"`).
/// * `args` - A slice of arguments to pass to the command (e.g., `&["-r", "/src", "/dest"]`).
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` - The command executed successfully.
/// * `Err(String)` - An error message describing the failure, including stdout and stderr if applicable.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if:
/// - The `sudo` command fails to spawn (e.g., `sudo` is not installed).
/// - The command exits with a non-zero status, indicating failure.
/// - The command’s output cannot be captured or processed.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use glwiz::functionality::commands::run_sudo_command;
/// let result = run_sudo_command("cp", &["/src/file", "/dest/file"]);
/// match result {
///     Ok(()) => println!("File copied successfully"),
///     Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to copy file: {}", e),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
/// Use caution when running commands with `sudo`, as they execute with root privileges and can modify
/// critical system files. Ensure `command` and `args` are validated to prevent unintended consequences.
